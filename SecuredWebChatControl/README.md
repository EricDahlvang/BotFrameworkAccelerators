# Secured Web Chat Control
This accelerator shows the recommended way to securely embed a Web Chat control on a web page so that the bot secret is 
not exposed.  You can also use it to create a quick test page so others can explore or test your bot rather than having
to use bot emulator or the portal.

For more information about securely embedding a Web Chat conrol, see the Direct Line documentation
