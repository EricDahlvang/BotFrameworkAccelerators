# Bot Development Accelerator Workshop
This workshop *IS NOT* about how to build A BOT, it’s about how to build *YOUR BOT*!  Think of it as a "one-stop shop" 
for building your first enterprise bot.  Its part recipe, part master plan, which you can use to accelerate your bot
journey from conception to production deployment.  You’ll move step-by-step through the Plan and Build phases 
to build your bot and complete this workshop and then you'll use the other links in the master plan as you continue 
to extend and refine your bot all the way through to production deployment.

There is a screen recording of an entire example workshop [here](http://tobecreatelater.com) which might be helpful
in the following scenarios :
* Instructors preparing to lead a workshop
* Brave self-learners who want to see if they can get from A to Z on their own
* Workshop graduates who want to review someting they had later forgot or became confused about
